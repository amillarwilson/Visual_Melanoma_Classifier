# Visual Melanoma Classifier

# Introduction
Melanomas are a common and potentially deadly form of cancer for which there are few effective national screening efforts, and little public awareness. The current guidelines for patients in the UK is to self-check regularly, and report to a GP when new moles or irregular patches of skin arise. 

But how do patients recognise melanomas? It can be difficult to recognise a melanoma, with the American Academy of Dermatology recommending the "ABCDE" system, with each letter describing an aspect fo the appearance or behaviour of a melanoma that differentiates it from a normal mole.

A project which uses machine learning to analyse photographs of concerning moles, classifying them into normal moles (naevi, sing. naevus) or melanomas.
