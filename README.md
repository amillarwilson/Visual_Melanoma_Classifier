# Visual Melanoma Classifier

# Introduction
Melanomas are a common and potentially deadly form of cancer for which there are few effective national screening efforts, and little public awareness. The current guidelines for patients in the UK is to self-check regularly, and report to a GP when new moles or irregular patches of skin arise. This system, however, seems sub-optimal with many patients globally waiting up to 6 months before even seeking a medical opinion.



A project which uses machine learning to analyse photographs of concerning moles, classifying them into normal moles (naevi, sing. naevus) or melanomas.
